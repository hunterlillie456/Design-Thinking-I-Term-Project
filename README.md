# Design-Thinking-I-Term-Project

Objectives
The objectives of this project are: 
1. To promote group work and the sharing of ideas and tasks. 
2. To promote life-long learning. 
3. To empower students with the opportunity to realize that they are capable of attaining skill sets on their own with some effort. 
4. To design and synthesize a challenge that requires putting together many of the concepts and elements learned throughout this semester.

Project Deadlines
This project is a group-based project and requires your group to produce a functional artifact. Your
group will also be required to give a ten-minute final presentation and demonstration on the date
indicated below. Your group will give a mock presentation prior to the main presentation. The
following are dates to keep on your calendar.
1. Sunday, November 29, 2020: Peer assessment
2. Monday, November 30, 2020: Mock Presentations
3. Thursday, December 3, 2020: Final Presentation
4. Sunday, December 6, 2020: Peer assessment
5. Monday, December 7, 2020 – Project submission.
Groups may request time with the instructor for help at any time. Each meeting presentation
should include specific work of each member of the team. The “mock” presentation exists to allow
the group to receive feedback for improvement before the final presentation.

Presentation Requirements
Your group will be required to give a presentation, which must include a PowerPoint document or
similar that will be used to convey the ideas incorporated into your project. Your group will
demonstrate the project at the end of the presentation (see section on Project Demonstration). The
presentation should include the following elements:
1. An introductory slide that motivates your talk. This slide should answer the question, why
should you pay attention to my talk? Note: Please DO NOT put on the slide or say in
your presentation, why should you pay attention to my talk? This slide or your
presentation of it should grab the attention of your audience.
2. The body of your talk should address the following:
a. A description of how your group’s objectives were achieved as it relates to this
work;
b. A description of the design process used in this project;
c. A description of the architecture, protocols, or any other process or methodology
used to accomplish the design challenge;
d. A description of the design concepts used in the prototyping phase and anything
else considered to be important in your project.
e. A clear explanation of how the SCRUM methodology was applied in your project
as well as the roles in the group; how the strengths and weaknesses of each member
played a role in this project. There should be an explanation of some of the
challenges encountered (avoid things like communication, scheduling, etc. These
are things that you had ample time addressing).
3. A conclusion or summary slide that winds down your talk appropriately.
A couple of recommendations on making and using PowerPoint slides:
• Slides should not be cluttered with a lot of wording. Bullet points should be placed to
guide you and the audience. The audience should be listening to you. If a bullet point is
verbose, then the audience will cease listening to you and begin reading.
• Whenever possible, use graphical illustrations to communicate your ideas and concepts.
Illustrations are a very powerful way of communicating abstract or difficult concepts.
• Use animation only when appropriate. Overuse of animation can detract from your
message and come across as pretentious. Ask your instructor to give you a quick tutorial
on how to animate properly.

Please make sure that the presentation is prepared well in advance of the talk. Ensure that your
presentation covers all the elements discussed above as well as those in the rubrics (available at
the end of this document). Make sure that every member is familiar with all aspects of the project.
Those working on specific tasks in the project will be the group’s experts on those specific tasks.
However, each member must program some component in this project. You may help each
other with the coding. Make sure that this is coordinated, logically organized in your presentation,
and communicated within the group.
As in everything, practice makes perfect! Groups should practice their presentation before and
after receiving feedback. Make sure that everyone knows their role. The audience should not have
to see the group figure things out during the presentation. If this happens, your group will surely
loose points!
Project Demonstration
You may choose to demonstrate your project before or after your presentation. Make sure you
articulate your needs for the presentation ahead of time. This is especially true if you require
special equipment.
Submitting Your Work
You are required to submit the following documents:
1. The design thinking process with all steps taken in your project (NOTE: This needs to be
documented on the group’s blog page). This should include a description of your
prototyping of the game.
2. The completed project, including any Python files, or any other artifact that resulted from
this projected. (NOTE: This should be available on GitHub and a link placed from the
group’s blog page). Please use the links to these artifacts when submitting on Blackboards.
3. The PowerPoint presentation used in the talk, submitted on Blackboard.
The ScrumMaster or any designee may submit for the entire group.
If your group does not present, then the entire group will receive no credit on the presentation part
of your grade. If you do not submit your work by the submission deadline, then the entire group
will receive no credit on the group project. If a team member is not present for the presentation,
then that team member will receive a zero (0) for the presentation and their performance on the
project will be scrutinized heavily.
Organize item 1 above in a logical manner so that there is clarity and continuity to the reader.
